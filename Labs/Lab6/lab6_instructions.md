# Lab6: "Non-functional testing"

## Purpose

This lab aims to introduce different kinds of non-functional testing. The purpose will be to assert the system under test from one of those characteristics, and to produce a relevant and professional test report.

## Task description

Pick one of the following qualities and update the test plans with a test strategy for selected quality:

- Concurrency
- Reliability
- Robustness
- Stability
- Authorization
- UI Accessibility

"Explore and pick two tools to aid the testing or create your own tool using Python and lessons learned from previous labs. Oracles and guidelines for the chosen characteristic may also count if they provide relevant support to the testing being undertaken, as an example "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" (WCAG) could be used when doing UI Accessibility testing".

Execute the plan, and upload screenshots with their test setup and testing results. Ie write a test report following your test session as if you were reporting to a stakeholder within the organization.
