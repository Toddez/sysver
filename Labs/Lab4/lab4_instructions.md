# Lab4: "Exploratory testing with charters"

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to exploratory testing as an approach and how it differs from scripted test cases (both manual and automated).
The amount of unique and varied testing that can be done with exploratory testing is vastly different than that of scripted testing. 
Charters will be introduced as well to show how exploratory testing can go from freestyle exploratory to charters.
